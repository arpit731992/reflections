What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	we need to initialize a repository or directory or folder to to tell git to start tracking the commits
	that will  be added later. so basically to start trackin the history of the files in repository.
	git init to initialize and git status to check status of files and commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	we can add files to the staging area which is between working directory(Hardrive) and repository.
	when we havn't added anything to the staging area, git status will show all the files are untracked and
	there is no commit so its waiting for initial commit.
	when we add a file or two it goes to the staging area, which then goes to the repository when commited.
