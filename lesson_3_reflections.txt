When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  when i want to share my work with others and when i have to showcase my projects or
  add other developers for the their reviews and help.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because if there are many people working on a repository /project anything which is being pushed by them will be updated to the local machine
  which we don not want until we have a look at it ourselves.
